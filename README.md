* [Cyber Triage](http://www.cybertriage.com) - Cyber Triage remotely collects and analyzes endpoint data to help determine if it is compromised.  Itâ€™s agentless approach and focus on ease of use and automation allows companies to respond without major infrastructure changes and without a team of forensics experts.  Its results are used to decide if the system should be erased or investigated further.
* [Doorman](https://github.com/mwielgoszewski/doorman) - osquery fleet manager that allows remote management of osquery configurations retrieved by nodes.
